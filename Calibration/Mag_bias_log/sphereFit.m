function [r,a,b,c] = sphereFit(data)
%This is a solution based on linearizing the sphere equation.
%The solution is not least-squares in its truest form, however this result
%is good enough for most purposes. This can be an input for the initual
%guess while using the Gauss-Newton or the Levenbergé‚¦arquardt algorithm 
%
% The data has to be in 3 columns and at least 4 rows, first column with Xs, 
% 2nd column with Ys and 3rd columns with Zs of the sphere data. 
% The output 
% r = radius
% a = X coordinate of the center
% b = Y coordinate of the center
% c = Z coordinate of teh center
%
% usage: sphereFit(data) % where data is a mx3 data and m>=4

AA = [-2*xx, -2*yy , -2*zz , ones(size(xx))];

a = YY(1);
